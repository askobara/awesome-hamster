Dependencies
============

 - Awesome WM
 - Hasmter Time Tracker (usually called hamster-applet in most
   distros)
 - Python 2
 - pygtk
 - python-dbus
 - python-gobject


Copying the scripts to a place you like
=======================================

Put both scripts (awehamster.py and awehamster-gui.py) in some
directory of your preference (for this document, I'm going to assume
you've put them in $HOME/bin), and give them the execution permission
bit.

# cp awehamster.py awehamster-gui.py ~/bin
# chmod +x ~/bin/awehamster.py ~/bin/awehamster-gui.py


Creating a placeholder in Awesome WM
====================================

AwesomeHamster is not an actual awesome WM widget. Instead, it uses a
textbox placeholder, changing dynamically its contents via Dbus. Thus
you need to create such a placeholder in your wibox. Try adding this
in your "rc.lua" somewhere near "mytextbox" and "mytextclock" definition.

myawehamsterbox = widget({ type = "textbox" })
myawehamsterbox.text = "AwesomeHamster Placeholder"

And now you must add this widget to your wibox. Change its definition
to look like this:

    mywibox[s].widgets = {
        {
            mylauncher,
            mytaglist[s],
            mypromptbox[s],
            layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.leftright
        },
        mylayoutbox[s],
        mytextclock,
        s == 1 and mysystray or nil,
        myawehamsterbox,
        mytasklist[s],
        layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.rightleft
    }


Defining some convenient shortcuts
==================================

I like to use "Mod+s" to stop tracking, and "Mod+a" to launch the gui
for selecting a new activity. This is what I got in my "rc.lua":

new_activity = "~/bin/awehamster-gui.py"
stop_tracking = "/usr/bin/hamster-cli stop"
(...)
    awful.key({ modkey,           }, "a", function () awful.util.spawn(new_activity) end),
    awful.key({ modkey,           }, "s", function () awful.util.spawn(stop_tracking) end),


Starting it with your session
=============================

Add this to the end of your "rc.lua":

awful.util.spawn_with_shell("~/bin/awehamster.py")
